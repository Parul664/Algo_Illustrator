## Project Title:
#### Algo_Illustrator

## Project Discription:
Algo-Illustrator aims at developing a Graphical User Interface for students for understanding algorithms visually via animations for any input graph of reasonable size.

## Tools used:
The project is developed in python with the help of pygame and Tkinter without the help of graph plotting libraries like Networkx in python.

Please find the video attached for the sample animation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iZka0_Qq1aJxs-QsSlPxBExhAQHsFW1Y/view?usp=sharing)

Algorithm: Dijkstra Shortest Path 

##### Input Graph:

Vertices: 6

Edges: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3],[1,4],[5,1]]
